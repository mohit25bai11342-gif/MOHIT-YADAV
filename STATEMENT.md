Project Statement Document
Elder Health Monitoring & SOS Alert System
1. Purpose of the Project Statement

This document clearly explains the intention, direction, and overall vision behind the Elder Health Monitoring & SOS Alert System. It defines what the project aims to achieve, why it is needed, and the boundaries within which it operates. Unlike a README—which focuses on running the program—this statement focuses on the bigger picture and the motivation behind building the system.

2. Problem Statement

Today, many elderly individuals live by themselves, often without constant support or supervision. During sudden health issues—like abnormal heart rate, high fever, low oxygen levels, or unconsciousness—there is usually no one immediately available to help. Such delays can increase the risk of serious medical complications.
This situation highlights the need for a simple, automated monitoring system that constantly checks vital signs and raises an alert the moment something unusual happens.

3. Project Goals

The project is designed with a few clear goals in mind:

Build an automated system capable of simulating and monitoring vital signs

Detect abnormal readings through fixed thresholds

Generate quick SOS alerts whenever danger-like conditions appear

Create a beginner-friendly model suitable for student learning

Provide a foundation for future integration with real sensors and IoT systems

4. Scope of the Project
In-Scope (covered in this version)

Simulation of heart rate and body temperature

Detecting abnormalities based on thresholds

Console-based real-time monitoring

Automatic SOS alerts

Clean and modular coding structure

Out-of-Scope (not included yet)

Real hardware sensor support

Mobile or web applications

Cloud connectivity or online dashboards

Actual SMS/Call alert APIs

These features may be added in advanced versions later.

5. Significance of the Project

This project is important because it shows how basic programming principles can be used to solve serious real-life problems. It introduces learners to the concept of healthcare automation, which is rapidly becoming an essential part of modern IoT and smart-care systems. The project promotes early detection and timely response—two crucial factors in keeping elderly individuals safe, especially when help is not nearby.

7. System Constraints

While the system is useful as a learning model, it comes with some limitations:

It uses simulated values, not real sensor data

The interface is limited to the command line

It doesn't use external APIs for sending alerts

Thresholds are fixed and do not adapt automatically

Requires Python to be installed on the user’s system

8. Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, the user can expect:

A working prototype that demonstrates automated health monitoring

Reliable detection of unusual or dangerous vital patterns

A better understanding of how modular and logical program design works

A basic system that can later be expanded into a full IoT-based health device

9. Potential Use Cases

This project can be applied in several situations:

Classroom demonstrations for IoT or Python programming

Prototype for future elderly care monitoring systems

Home monitoring environments

Student projects centered on safety automation

Early-stage models for Raspberry Pi or sensor-based integration

10. Innovation and Uniqueness

What makes this project stand out is its ability to turn simple Python concepts into something meaningful and practical. It acts as a bridge between basic coding logic and real-world healthcare needs. The alert system also mirrors the behavior of actual medical monitoring devices, giving students hands-on experience with core safety mechanisms. The structure of the program is clean, modular, and ready for expansion into advanced IoT solutions.

11. Limitations

Although helpful for learning, the project has certain limitations:

Simulated values cannot represent real medical accuracy

Caregivers cannot receive actual alerts through calls or messages

The system is not suitable for real medical usage

Console-only display may be difficult for non-technical users

12. Ethical Considerations

Health-related systems—even simulations—must follow ethical guidelines. Real-world versions would require proper privacy protection, secure handling of personal data, and reliable alert mechanisms. It is important to avoid false alarms or missed warnings.
This project should be used only for educational and prototyping purposes, not as a medical device.

13. Future Scope

There are many ways this system can grow in the future:

Adding real pulse and temperature sensors

Integrating IoT boards like Raspberry Pi or ESP32

Developing a mobile notification system

Storing long-term data on the cloud

Using AI or ML to predict health emergencies
