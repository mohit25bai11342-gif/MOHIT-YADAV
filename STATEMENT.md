Project Statement Document
Elder Health Monitoring & SOS Alert System
1. Purpose of the Project Statement

This document clearly defines the purpose, goals, scope, and technical direction of the Elder Health Monitoring & SOS Alert System. It explains what the project aims to achieve, the boundaries within which it operates, and the value it provides. Unlike a README that explains how to run the program, this document focuses on the why, what, and overall intent of the project.

2. Problem Statement

A large number of elderly individuals live alone, making them vulnerable during sudden medical emergencies such as irregular heart rate, high fever, low oxygen levels, or fainting. Without constant supervision, these emergencies often go unnoticed until it is too late. There is a strong need for a simple, automated, continuous monitoring system that can detect abnormal vital signs and raise alerts immediately.

3. Project Goals

Provide an automated system that simulates and monitors vital signs

Detect abnormal health patterns using predefined thresholds

Alert users instantly during emergency-like conditions

Offer a low-cost, beginner-friendly model suitable for academic learning

Create a base structure for future real IoT sensor integration

4. Scope of the Project
In-Scope

Simulation of heart rate and body temperature

Threshold-based abnormal condition detection

Console-based real-time monitoring

Automatic SOS alert generation

Modular and readable code structure

Out-of-Scope (for this version)

Real hardware sensors

Mobile or web application

Real-time cloud integration

Actual communication APIs (SMS/Call)
(These can be included in future versions.)

5. Significance of the Project

This project shows how basic programming concepts can address real-world safety challenges. It introduces students to healthcare automation—an important part of IoT and smart technology. The system promotes safety, early detection, and quick response, which are essential in elder care and home-health monitoring setups.

6. Methodology Overview

Simulation Layer – Generates random vital values using Python

Monitoring Logic – Continuously checks values against safe limits

Decision Engine – Determines if vitals are normal, warning-level, or critical

Alert System – Prints SOS alerts during danger conditions

Modular Structure – Each function has a clear, separate responsibility

7. System Constraints

No real sensor data (values are simulated)

Console-based interface limits usability

No external API integration for communication

Predefined, static thresholds

Requires Python environment to run

8. Expected Outcomes

A working prototype demonstrating elder health monitoring

Reliable detection of abnormal health patterns

Clear understanding of modular program design

A base model ready for IoT and health-tech expansion

9. Potential Use Cases

Academic demonstrations for IoT or Python courses

Early prototype for real elder-care systems

Home health monitoring

Student projects focusing on automation and safety

Introductory model for sensor-based Raspberry Pi integration

10. Innovation and Uniqueness

Converts simple Python concepts into a real-world application

Bridges software logic with healthcare monitoring needs

Provides an expandable foundation for IoT projects

Uses a structured alert mechanism similar to medical devices

11. Limitations

No medical accuracy (simulated data onl
